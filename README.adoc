== Disclaimer

This plugin is a personal project that I made for my own education and use. A couple
people expressed interest in it so I'm sharing it but with the following caveats:

* You can file bugs but I make no guarantees about when/if they'll be addressed
  (though major bugs that I can easily reproduce will probably be fixed quickly).
* Unless they happen to align with existing plans, enhancement requests are even less
  likely to be addressed (though I'll definitely read them).
* I don't currently have time to review pull requests but may be open to that in the
  future if there's much interest (though I'm not expecting this to reach a lot of
  people).
* This has only been tested on my personal PC but there I've tested using Vim in
  Cygwin and Ubuntu (by way of WSL) and using gvim on Windows 10. "Testing" mostly
  consists of me using it for what its intended for.
* There are no help docs. The sum total of documentation is this README.

That _all_ being said, what was first and foremost an educational project has turned
into a super useful tool to me that I use all the time so why the heck not put it out
there?

== Overview

_If you just want to jump in and go a quick read of <<_hot_keys, Hot Keys>> should be
all that you need._

I regularly edit text containing Asciidoc markup and thought it would convenient to
be able to easily jump to any section in such documents. Since I'm a long-time coder 
and Vim fan I thought rather than use something already available I'd make it an
excuse to improve my Vim knowledge. Never written a Vim plugin before.

All this does, essentially, is open a menu when called in which all of the document's
sections are available and which can be navigated as a hierarchy (as opposed to
displaying all of them at once). Choose a section and you will be taken to its
header.

Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. Funny how much nuance there is for
something that sounds so simple on paper. I try to cover most of that below (though
that's a WIP).

Currently this is tested with Asciidoc and, lightly, with Markdown (see
<<_markdown_issues, Markdown Issues>>). The 'mu' in musecnav is for 'markup' so the
idea is to support whatever formats are needed. There's a bit more information on
supporting additional formats in <<_plans, Plans>>.

== Installation

Standard stuff if you use a plugin manager that plays nice with GitHub, e.g.

.vim-plug configuration
----
Plug 'b-layer/musecnav'
----

== Feature Details

Besides the obvious stuff mentioned above I note some less apparent details here.

You can use either a slide-up (from the status line) menu or, with newer versions of
Vim, a popup window. With a compatible version you'll get the popup by default.
Otherwise you'll see the slide-up. To change this see <<_settings, Settings>>.

When the menu is displayed its state should always reflect the current section
hierarchy and the current cursor position (see <<_reset, Hot Keys - Reset>>). As a
result, it can be used just to 'get your bearings' in a large document.

The sections visible at any particular time in the menu depend on what has been
selected by the user prior. If user hasn't selected anything since start/reset you'll
see:

   Document root (level 0)
     All level 1 section headers

When a (level 1) section is chosen you'll see:

   Document root (level 0)
     All level 1 section headers
       Selected section's subtree

When a section header deeper than level 1 is selected it'll be:

   Document root (level 0)
     Selection parent (at level N-1)
       All of the selection parent's children (level N)
         Selected section's subtree (level N+1 and down)

I suspect if there's anything for which people would have a lot of differing ideas
about what is the "right" way, it's going to be related to this.

=== Hot Keys

kbd:[F7] :: Open the navigation menu (popup or message based depending on config).

==== Popup Menu

kbd:[Up]/kbd:[Down] or kbd:[J]/kbd:[K] :: Select row above/below the currently selected row.
Numbers 1-99 :: Jump to a row by number (see next section).
kbd:[Enter] :: Go to section matching selected row. Menu remains open. If you
hit kbd:[Enter] again immediately (without choosing another row) the menu will close.
kbd:[Esc] / kbd:[Ctrl+C] / kbd:[X] :: Other ways to close the menu (at any time).

==== Slide-up Menu

Numbers 1-99 :: Rows are chosen by entering their associated number followed by Enter.
kbd:[Esc] / kbd:[Ctrl+C] or kbd:[Enter] by itself :: Close the menu.


==== Reset

`musecnav` monitors the current buffer and if it detects a change that could impact
the line numbers of any sections in the saved hierarchy it will rescan the file and
rebuild the hierarchy the next time the menu is opened. Nonetheless, you may
occasionally want or need to use one of these:

kbd:[Shift+F7] :: 'Soft reset'. Rescan section headers and open the navigation
  menu. Cursor position will be preserved.

kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+F7] :: 'Hard reset'. Rescan section headers, reset the
  cursor to the first line of the document and open the navigation menu.

=== Numerical Selection in the Popup

A nice feature is being able to choose sections by entering the associated number.
(By default Vim popups don't support this which means you might have 50 sections on
screen but no way to navigate them except up or down, one line at a time!) That being
said, the way I implemented _might_ seem a little peculiar. So I spell out the
algorithm here.

There is a 1-digit 'buffer' that is empty when menu is opened.

* User enters a number when buffer is empty...
** ...if number matches a single row, and is not the first digit of any other row numbers select the matching row (buffer remains empty)
** ...if number could match multiple rows, select first of potential matches and
   buffer the number
* User enters a number when buffer is not empty...
** ...if combined number (previous is most significant digit, new is least
   significat) matches a single row, select that row and clear buffer.
** ...if combined number doesn't match a row, discard new number (previous number
   remains in buffer)

Example: 32 rows. User enters 3. Select line 3 and buffer num (in case they intend to
go to 30, 31 or 32). User then enters 5. No
row 35 so discard 5 (leaving 3 in buffer and row 3 selected) User enters 1. Select
row 31 and clear buffer. User enters 9. Select row 9 but don't buffer num (no rows
90-99). User
enters 2. Select row 2 and buffer num. Etc. When user finally accepts selection with
Enter buffer is always cleared.

If you get confused hit Enter and retype desired number. (Though, really, it's not
THAT confusing.;) 

CAUTION: This only works for 2-digit numbers so if you have 100 or more sections
visible in the menu _at one time_ (!) the behavior is undefined. (The most I've seen
at once, and I regularly navigate a 250-section bad boy, is about 80.)

== Settings

There are currently just a couple user accessible settings...

Turn off popups with

    let g:musecnav_use_popup = 0

Change the in-menu 'current section' indicator like so:

    let g:musecnav_place_mark = '*'

Change the popup menu color scheme by setting Popup and PopupSelected highlight, e.g.

    hi Popup guifg=#3030ff guibg=black
    hi PopupSelected guifg=black guibg=#a0a0ff

== Performance

I regularly use the plugin with an asciidoc file having 250 sections across more than
8000 lines and, almost always, it's super fast and smooth in each of my vim/gvim
versions. (Caveat: I do have a pretty beefy PC.) I say almost always because for
reasons I don't yet understand it occasionally takes 10 or so seconds to scan the
file. Not every time I open a document launch the popup or every time I do a hard
reset (Ctrl-F7) but _some_ of those times. I need to investigate but it's rare so I
don't feel much urgency. I'd be interested in hearing from anyone having a
significantly more negative go of it.

== Markdown Issues

There is currently rudimentary support for the Markdown format. The common ways of
indicating headers are recognized per the following:

----
  # H1
  ## H2
  ### H3
  #### H4
  ##### H5
  ###### H6
  
  Note: Some implementations allow omitting the space after the '#'s. musecnav
  allows for this.
  
  Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:
  
  Alt-H1
  ======
  
  Alt-H2
  ------
----

There must be a blank line preceding each header. This helps eliminate some issues
such as the one described next but if it turns out to be blocking valid markdown or
otherwise more trouble than its worth I'll change it.

Some corner cases will trip up _musecnav_. For example, if you have
a code section (ie. delimited by `++```++`) containing Bash and it includes a Bash
comment (e.g. '# this is a comment') in the first column it will be mistakenly
identified as a Markdown header.

== Plans

As mentioned earlier I may support additional markup formats. It's really easy to add
new formats so it works most of the time. Just match a pattern. That hard(er) part is
sniffing out the exceptions and handling them. For example, Asciidoc allows section
headers independent of the main hierarchy by preceding them with `[discrete]`. Code
had to be added to ignore these. Another example with Asciidoc but this one isn't yet
handled...

If you use Asciidoc feature allowing other files to be included in the master
document the popup will ignore sections in those files. I will eventually correct
this.

At a minimum, I want to fix relatively common scenarios in Markdown that currently
trip up _musecnav_ such as the one described in the previous section.
